  "summary": "Implemented a reusable SocialLinks component with centralized config and integrated it into Header and Footer. Footer integration is missing the required “Follow us” label. Header mobile integration is truncated, so compliance with new-tab/rel/accessibility requirements for the mobile-rendered social links cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-93",
      "requirement": "Footer displays a “Follow us” (English) label and a horizontal row of social icons/links when at least one social URL is configured.",
      "reason": "Footer shows “Get in Touch” and renders <SocialLinks /> but does not include the explicit “Follow us” label required by the acceptance criteria.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/layout/Footer.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-94",
      "requirement": "All header social links meet the same accessibility and security requirements as the footer links (English aria-labels, new-tab behavior, rel attributes), including on mobile.",
      "reason": "Desktop header uses the SocialLinks component (which sets target/_blank, rel, aria-label), but the mobile dropdown renders social links via a custom map; the diff is truncated before showing whether the DropdownMenuItem/asChild uses an <a> with target=\"_blank\", rel=\"noopener noreferrer\", and accessible labeling.",
