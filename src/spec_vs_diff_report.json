  "summary": "Map and Similar Schools components/hooks were added and wired into the School Detail page, but the embedded Google Maps iframe implementation appears to rely on a Google Maps Embed API URL format that requires an API key, conflicting with the no-API-key requirement.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-19",
      "requirement": "Implement the Google Maps option as a reusable component that can render a responsive embedded map iframe or link-only fallback without requiring any API key or third-party SDK.",
      "reason": "The embedded iframe URL uses `https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=&q=...`, which is a Google Maps Embed API endpoint that requires an API key; providing an empty `key=` does not satisfy the requirement to avoid API keys and may result in a broken embed.",
