  "summary": "REQ-114/115/116 appear largely implemented: SchoolProfileBanner now supports multiple slides with prev/next controls, keyboard arrow handling, and an image-load fallback; SchoolDetailPage now passes curated gallery images via getCuratedGalleryImages(school.id) with fallback to the existing default banner image. New aria-labels are in English. Due to truncation, exact preservation of the previous overlay/name/location/button layout cannot be fully verified from the diff excerpt.",
