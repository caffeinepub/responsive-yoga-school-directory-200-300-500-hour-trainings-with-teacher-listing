# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add 100-hour YTT as a first-class training hour option throughout the directory filtering and related informational copy.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Directory page training-hours filter checklist to include “100 Hours” alongside 200/300/500, and ensure selecting it filters results by trainings with `hours == 100` using existing filtering behavior.
- Update Directory hero subtitle and any hour-level enumerations in directory informational sections to include 100-hour programs (English copy).
- Extend the “Training Hour Levels Explained” section with a new “100-Hour YTT” card entry, matching the existing card layout and styling used for 200/300/500.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can filter schools by 100-hour YTT programs and will see 100-hour YTT reflected across directory hero text and hour-level informational sections.
